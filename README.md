## A<a name="A"></a>

**Abbreviations and acronyms**  
The first time you use an abbreviation or acronym explain it in full on each page unless it’s well known, like UK, DVLA, EU, VAT and MP. This includes government departments or schemes.

Do not use full stops in abbreviations: BBC, not B.B.C.

**Active voice**  
Use the active rather than passive voice. This will help us write concise, clear content.

**Addressing the user**  
Address the user as ‘you’ where possible. Content on the site often makes a direct appeal to citizens and businesses to get involved or take action: ‘You can contact the Environment Agency by phone and email’ for example.

**Ampersand**  
Use 'and' rather than &, unless it’s used in company names when the company does: Johnson & Johnson, Marks & Spencer, P&O, etc.

**any more**  
Please do not say “anymore” any more

**area**  
Use 'location' unless referring to a 'flood warning area' or 'flood alert area'

**around**  
'About' or 'approximately' are better, e.g. “about £1m” or “approximately 2,000 properties”.

**Atlantic**  
Capitalised

## B<a name="B"></a>

**basically**  
This word is unnecessary, basically.

**both**  
Unnecessary in most phrases that contain “and”; “both men and women” says no more than “men and women”, takes longer, and can also be ambiguous.

**brackets**  
If the sentence is logically and grammatically complete without the information contained within the parentheses (round brackets), the punctuation stays outside the brackets. (A complete sentence that stands alone in parentheses starts with a capital letter and ends with a stop.)

**bridges**  
Use initial capitals, eg Golden Gate Bridge, Waterloo Bridge

**business**  
Use 'property' instead

**Bullet points and steps**  
You can use bullet points to make text easier to read. Make sure that:

* you always use a lead-in line
* the bullets make sense running on from the lead-in line
* you use lower case at the start of the bullet
* you do not use more than one sentence per bullet point - use commas or dashes to expand on an item
* you do not put ‘or’ or ‘and’ after the bullets
* you do not put a semicolon at the end of a bullet
* there is no full stop after the last bullet point

Bullets should normally form a complete sentence following from the lead text. But it’s sometimes necessary to add a short phrase to clarify whether all or some of the points apply. 

## C<a name="C"></a>

**Capitalisation**  
DO NOT USE BLOCK CAPITALS FOR LARGE AMOUNTS OF TEXT AS IT’S QUITE HARD TO READ.

Always use lower case, even in page titles. The exceptions to this are proper nouns, and:

* buildings
* place names
* brand names
* names of groups, directorates and organisations: Knowledge and Innovation Group

**catchment**  
Lower case unless at beginning of sentence

**chart datum**  
Lower case unless at beginning of sentence

**click**  
Don’t use 'click' when talking about user interfaces because not all users click. Use 'select'.

**coast**  
Lower case unless at beginning of sentence

**confidence**  
Should be expressed as being either 'high', 'medium' or 'low'

**contact**  
Use 'contact', 'contacts' or 'contact details'

**council**  
Lower case even in a name: 'Wandsworth council'

## D<a name="D"></a>

**Dates**  

* use upper case for months: January, February
* do not use a comma between the month and year: 4 June 2017
* when space is an issue - in tables or publication titles, for example - you can use truncated months: Jan, Feb
* we use ‘to’ in date ranges - not hyphens, en rules or em dashes. For example: tax year 2011 to 2012
* Monday to Friday, 9am to 5pm (put different days on a new line, do not separate with a comma) 10 November to 21 December
* when referring to today include the date: ‘Flood alert in force for today (14 June 2019) for the…’

**defences**  
Not 'defenses'

**district council**  
Lower case even in a name, like 'Warwick district council'

## E<a name="E"></a>

**eg, etc and ie**  
'example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’ - whichever works best in the specific context.

'etc' can usually be avoided. Try using ‘for example’ or ‘such as’ or ‘like’ or ‘including’. Never use etc at the end of a list starting with these words.

'ie' - used to clarify a sentence - is not always well understood. Try (re)writing sentences to avoid the need to use it. If that is not possible, use an alternative such as ‘meaning’ or ‘that is’.

**email**  
One word

**Environment Agency**  
Not 'EA' or 'environment agency'

## G<a name="G"></a>

**Geography and regions**

So, the south-west (compass direction), but the South West (administrative region).

Always write out the full name of the area the first time you use it.

**phone**  
Not 'telephone'

**police**  
Lower case, even when referring to 'the police'

**police service**  
Lower case. Note that police force is usually avoided

**Professional Partners**

**telephone numbers**

**tidal**  
Lower case unless at beginning of sentence

**threshold**  
Use 'level' instead for example 'The Flood alert level has been reached'

**Times**  
use ‘to’ in time ranges, not hyphens, en rules or em dashes: 10am to 11am (not 10-11am)
* 5:30pm (not 1730hrs)
* midnight (not 00:00)
* midday (not 12 noon, noon or 12pm)
* 6 hours 30 minutes

Midnight is the first minute of the day, not the last. You should consider using '11:59pm' to avoid confusion about a single, specific time. For example, 'Flood warning in force until 11:59pm on Tuesday 14 June.' can only be read one way, but 'Flood warning in force until midnight on Tuesday 14 June' can be read in two ways (the end of Monday 13, or end of Tuesday 14).
